# you can use spaces in a key
# definition, instead of underscores

key with spaces = 'works!'
# equivalent to:
key_with_spaces = "it's actually not bro"

# you can also use spaces in keys
# that need a dot notation.
# spaces around dots will be ignored

key . with . spaces = 42
# equivalent to
key.with.spaces = 42

another example of . spaced key = yes
